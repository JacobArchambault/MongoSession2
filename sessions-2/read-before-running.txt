if thre were no package.json file, we'd need to run   npm init -y   but it is not necessary here.

    npm install express mongoose express-handlebars body-parser express-session --save

if we still need the work-around, then also

    npm install handlebars@4.5.3 --save

mongo needs to be running locally
