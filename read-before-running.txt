if thre were no package.json file, we'd need to run   npm init -y  but if the package.json file is properly put together, then npm init -y is unnecessary.

To install dependencies assuming express, mongoose, express-handlebars, body-parser and express-session, use

    npm install express mongoose express-handlebars body-parser express-session --save
    npm install @handlebars/allow-prototype-access

mongod needs to be running locally before running index.js

the dependencies in the package.json file should look like this (your version numbers may be different)

"dependencies": {
    "@handlebars/allow-prototype-access": "^1.0.3",
    "axios": "^0.18.0",
    "body-parser": "^1.19.0",
    "cookie-parser": "^1.4.3",
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "express-handlebars": "^3.1.0",
    "express-session": "^1.17.0",
    "mongoose": "^5.9.4"
  }

and if so, instead of running the two npm install commands, to install the dependencies you only need to run

   npm install

as always, to run index.js

   node index.js
